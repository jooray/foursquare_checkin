foursquare_checkin
==================

Programmatic checkin to foursquare

This simple Python script uses mobile web access to foursquare to allow programmatic checkin. It was written
to show that programmatic checkin is possible and that sites like topguest can be cheated - giving something
for checkin should be avoided. (I've been told that topguest actually does a pretty good job at detecting
programmatic checkins).

It can also be used if you want to fake your checkins for other reasons.

Web checkins do not count for any badges or mayor status, since they do not use GPS.

The author no longer uses foursquare. You should decide for yourself.
